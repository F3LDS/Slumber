Slumber in Love2D
=======

This is slumber rewritten to use the Love2D Lua game engine.

This gives us several advantages
* Easier to read code. Closer to Python in syntax
* Love2D is heavily documented and easy to grasp
* Still cross platform
* Get-it-done mentality. i.e. sprite animation requires 3 lines of code

As well as these disadvantages
* Not easily ported to iOS/Android
* Harder to obfuscate (not a big problem)

I feel this is a better path to creating our first game as apposed to spreading ourselves too thin by porting to too many platforms

If we wish to make a mobile game then we should write it to be exclusive to mobile platforms
